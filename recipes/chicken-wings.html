        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 pounds chicken wings</li>
            <li>1/2 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Italian salad dressing</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup hot sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare wings: combine chicken wings, soy sauce,
                and Italian dressing in a large plastic bag, coat wings
                with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal bag.
                Marinate in refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly
                oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare sauce: melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat.
                Stir in hot sauce and 1 tsp soy sauce until combined. Remove
                from heat and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>Remove chicken wings from marinade and pat dry; discard remaining
                marinade. Cook on the grill, turning occasionally, until chicken is
                browned and no longer pink (25 to 30 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>Place grilled wings in a large bowl. Pour butter sauce over wings;
                toss until well-coated.
            </li>
        </ol>
